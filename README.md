This is a simple Computer Graphics Project. The project is about a story. In this project, a boy proposes a girl. The girl may accept his proposal or reject it. In the background there is a song. The whole project is controlled by keyboard input. The user presses the computer keyboard button and there will be an action for it. The project is done in C(Programming Language).
